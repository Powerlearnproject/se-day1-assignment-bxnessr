Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is a field that designs, tests, develop, and maintain software system. It applies Engineering princioles to software development.
Software engineering is important in so many ways. It enhances seecurity, it improves, user experience, it increases trust and reliability.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Birth of Software Engineering (!968 NATO)
Emergency of Structured Programming (1970): pioneers like Edsger Dijkstra promoted structured programming, emphasizing control structures like loops, conditionals, and subroutines instead of the chaotic use of GOTO statements. The introduction of languages like Pascal, C, and Ada supported this paradigm
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1) Planning: It includes designing the project scope, Finanacing, Timeline, etc.
2) Required Analysis: It involves doing the necessary research and understanding what the software must do. 
3) Design: Designing a blueprint of the software archtecture and component.
4) Development: It is the stage of coding
5) Testing: Identifying and fixing problems and bugs.
6) Deploying:Making the software available for end-users.
7) MAintenance: Making sure the software keeps running and is up to date.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methology is for rigid Structured software development that involves stages which includes: Planning, Required Analysis, Design, Development, testing, Deployment, Maintenance.
Agile methology is more iterative and flexible. Used for creating moblie apps, and useer friendly software. Its broken down to different phases called Sprints.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-Software Developers build and maintain software.
-QA Engineers ensure the software works correctly and meets quality standards.
-Project Managers coordinate and oversee the entire project lifecycle to ensure timely and successful delivery.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
IDEs streamline software development by providing tools for coding, debugging, and project management in one interface. 
VCS enables efficient collaboration, tracks code changes, and allows version control and rollback. Together, they enhance productivity, minimize risks, and support seamless teamwork in software projects. Examples include VS Code, Git, and PyCharm.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing ensure software quality by verifying individual components, interactions, overall functionality, and user satisfaction. Together, they catch bugs early and validate requirements before deployment.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing clear, specific, and effective instructions for AI models to elicit accurate and relevant responses. It is crucial for maximizing AI performance, reducing ambiguity, and ensuring that outputs align with user goals, making interactions more efficient and results more reliable.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Create a report about sales."
"Prepare a 2-page report analyzing quarterly sales trends for Q1 2025, focusing on top-selling products, revenue growth, and regional performance. Include charts and actionable recommendations for improving sales."
